# Extracted from release.yml because TWO jobs need it and they must not
# disagree: `notes-gate` runs it to refuse a release whose notes were never
# written, and `release` runs it to build the GitHub Release body. When the awk
# lived inline in the gate only, the gate carefully produced notes.md and the
# release step then published a hardcoded body -- so every release shipped
# identical, already-stale text while a gate stood guard over notes nobody read.
#
# Present-but-empty is the failure mode to catch, not just a missing heading:
# `## [1.7.2]` followed by nothing is exactly what an interrupted release
# leaves behind, and it is indistinguishable from a real section to a `grep -q`
# on the heading alone.
